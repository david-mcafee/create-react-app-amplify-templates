# create-react-app-amplify-templates

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) templates. Will use `latest` version of Amplify + Amplify UI.

## Usage

### [cra-template-aws-amplify](js/cra-template-aws-amplify/README.md)

Basic template that installs the `latest` version of AWS Amplify, and adds the configuration step to `index.js`. Configuring your Amplify app (running `amplify init`, etc) must be done separately.

# Basic Create React App Template for AWS Amplify with TypeScript

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) template.

This template installs the `latest` version of AWS Amplify, and adds the configuration step to `index.tsx`.

## Usage

```bash
npx create-react-app my-amplify-app --template aws-amplify-typescript
```

For additional templates that include UI components, basic routing, etc, see my [AWS Amplify CRA Templates](https://github.com/david-mcafee/create-react-app-amplify-templates) repo.
